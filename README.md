# SE3002 Assignment 2 — Student Registration Module

This is the **system under test** for black-box and white-box testing, not a reference-correct solution.

## Files
- `registration.py`: Python application to test.
- `REQUIREMENTS.md`: authoritative functional requirements, status strings, and sample scenarios.
- `requirements.txt`: dependencies for test development.

## Getting started
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -c "from registration import Student, Course, register_course; print(register_course(Student('S001'), Course('CS201', 3, 30)))"
```

## Suggested student workflow
1. Derive ECP/BVA/decision table tests from `REQUIREMENTS.md` **without using implementation behavior as the expected result**.
2. Create `tests/test_blackbox.py`, execute the cases, and log suspected defects as GitHub Issues.
3. Inspect the code and develop `tests/test_whitebox.py` to exercise decisions, branches, conditions, and basis paths.
4. Document CFG and manual MC/DC pairs for a selected function.
5. Record failing tests faithfully. Do not alter expected results to force tests to pass.
6. Make any defect fixes in a separate Pull Request with accompanying regression tests.

Some tests may fail against the supplied source. This is intentional for the exercise.

## Our work (SQE Assignment 2)

### Repository layout
```
registration.py              system under test
REQUIREMENTS.md              SRS (source of expected results)
tests/test_blackbox.py       ECP, BVA, decision table and state tests
tests/test_whitebox.py       basis path, branch and MC/DC tests
docs/blackbox_test_design.xlsx
docs/decision_table.xlsx
docs/cfg.png                 CFG of registration_decision()
docs/testing_report.pdf      final report
.github/workflows/tests.yml  CI: pytest + coverage on every push / PR
```

### Running the tests
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest tests/test_blackbox.py -v
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=registration --cov-branch --cov-report=term-missing
```

Test IDs used in the code match the IDs in the design sheets (ECP-xx, BVA-xx,
DT-xx, ST-xx, WBxx). When one pytest case covers several design IDs the id
shows all of them, e.g. `ECP-15|BVA-13|DT-05`.
